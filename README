This script adds functions and properties to XMLHttpRequest witch can be used to create AJAX indicators.
Tested with GWT and jQuery, but the script doesn't use any AJAX/JS framework, so it _should_ work with most of them.
Works with IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari..., and has no effect on IE6 or older.

See example.html for usage and ajaxindicator.js for more information on the functions.
