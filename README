AJAX-activity-indicator
-----------------------

This script adds onOpenGlobal and onDoneGlobal functions and numberOfOpenCalls property to XMLHttpRequest,
thus it's possible to create AJAX activity indicators / progress bar. 
Operates with many AJAX/JS frameworks. (For example, GWT or jQuery.)
Works with IE7+, FF, Chrome etc, and has no effect on IE6 or older.
See example.html and ajaxindicator.js for more information.
